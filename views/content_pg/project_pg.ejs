                        <h2>2. <u>Photo Slider</u></h2>
                        <p>
                            Basically Photo Slider is the photo gallery which contains a lot of photos , organized in a proper manner ,if the user clicking to the next and previous buttons the images will be changed accordingly and also there was a button of “Add to Favorites” which works as adding a photo in the another Favorites folder. If user do not click any of the button the image automatically changes after few seconds.

                            <p>
                                In the last semester I completed this small project that can be used as a small component to make a professional ‘Pizza shop’ website. In this website I made a website that can preview the service like ordering pizza from a proper Menu, and Also option for the payment using different cards. Moreover, it provides the receipt of order to the customer by the mail. In this project I have used #c Programming ,GUI etc.
